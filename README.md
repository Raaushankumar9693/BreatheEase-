## 🌟 Inspiration

This project was inspired by a sports class discussion on the importance of rhythmic breathing. I realized many people struggle with breathing techniques not only in sports but in everyday life — especially when dealing with anxiety, stress, or lack of focus. Breathe Ease was built to provide a calming, accessible solution.
